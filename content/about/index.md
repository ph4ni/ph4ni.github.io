I'm Sai Phanindra. Welcome to my cute little corner on the inter webs! I spend my time reading random wikipedia articles, self-hosting various software, mapping wherever I go on OpenStreetMap, and feeding kittens. I write about things I love and post some random photos here.

You can find me on [Mastodon](https://fsmi.social/@ph4ni), [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/ph4ni), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ph4ni/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ph4ni), and other places on the internet. Oh I also write [FOSS Weekly.](https://fossweekly.beehiiv.com/)
